Within 5 minutes, we will build an **internet searching agent system** that can search the internet, check for plagiarism, and rewrite search results. This is a simple example of how to use Chetan to create an agent system.

```python title="quickstart.py">
from chetan import ChetanManager
from chetan.lm.openai import OpenAILM

from chetan.modules.rec import ToolRecommender
from chetan.modules.memory import SimpleKVMemory

from chetan.agent import AgentLoop

# Initialize a manager for organizing resources
mgr = ChetanManager()

llm = OpenAILM()

mgr.llm.default = llm

# Embedding-based recommender to suggest relevant tools
tool_rec = ToolRecommender() 
# based on the current context and user input
kv_mem = SimpleKVMemory(k=4)

# Sequentially use the agent modules
DefaultAgentLoop = AgentLoop().use(
  tool_rec,
  kv_mem
)

# Register the agent loop as default
mgr.agent_loops["default"] = DefaultAgentLoop
```
